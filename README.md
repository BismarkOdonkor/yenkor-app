## About Yencor

 YENCOR is an AI-powerd smart public transportation app developed by AFRICA BLOCKCHAIN CONSORTIUM & DIGITAL ECONOMY LIMITED in collaboration with students from the Ghana Communication Technology University, Accra - Ghana. Just like popular ride-hailing apps, but tailored for public buses, YENCOR makes traveling easier by helping you find buses going your way — with a few extra features to improve your journey.
Unlike traditional ride-hailing apps, YENCOR is built specifically for public buses, offering real-time tracking, intelligent route planning, and cashless payments—all powered by AI to improve efficiency and enhance your travel experience.

How AI enhances your YENCOR experience:

    ✅ Locate Available Buses: See nearby buses registered on the app and traveling towards your destination.
    ✅ Pin Your Location: Indicate where you’re waiting, so drivers know you’re at the bus-stop.
    ✅ Hop On and Go: Once you board and the bus moves from your location, your pin automatically sets your destination.
    ✅ Pay Easily: No need to carry cash — just scan the bus’ QR code to pay instantly.
    ✅ Personalized Travel Insights: App learns your commuting patterns and provides tailored recommendations.

Whether you’re commuting to work, school, or running errands, YENCOR simplifies your journey by bridging the gap between passengers and drivers. YENCOR helps you plan better, avoid the guesswork and long waits at the bus stop. We are here to make public transportation more reliable, predictable, and stress-free.
Wherever you’re headed, YENCOR connects you to the right bus, fast and hassle-free.
